The Duality of Art and Industry: Unraveling Artistic Mastery in Drake and Kendrick Lamar&#039;s Rap

The influence of hip hop has not been limited to the US but is also global. More and more people resonate with the genre than ever before (Mitchell, 2001). This has been possible due to the commercialization of hip-hop. Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G, Snoop Dog, Jay-Z, Nas, Lil Wayne, Ja Rule, and 50 Cents, just to name a few of the rappers that have profited from the commercialization of hip-hop leveraging the gangster rap trend to gain widespread recognition, accumulate cash, and establish lasting careers in the music industry (Robinson, 2011, p. 41). However, there has been a shift in the industry from gangster rap. Several recording labels look out for trending sounds, flows, and influence. In the realm of contemporary hip-hop music, two names often come up in conversations about modern rap music: Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Even while both musicians have made a lasting impression on the industry, a deeper look shows that Kendrick Lamar is the pinnacle of artistic brilliance, far surpassing Drake. This paper will accentuate why Kendrick Lamar is the epitome of artistic excellence. Through his artistic depth and substance, critical acclaim and cultural impact, experimental and innovative approach, authenticity and integrity, and longevity.

Drake is a splendid artist with a massive influence on mainstream media. He has sold millions of singles since 2020. In 2022, Drake earned ten new plaques from the RIAA (Record Industry Association of America), totaling 184 million singles sold (Sanchez,2022). He has 31.5 million more monthly listens on Spotify than Kendrick Lamar. For an industry fixated on numbers (streams and album sales), most listeners do not go through the artist&#039;s discography but tend to listen to trending songs on mainstream platforms. Kendrick Lamar&#039;s artistic depth and substance have kept him afloat in this industry. His music transcends mere entertainment. His profound storytelling has made him stand out in his generation; intense lyrics and thematic depth characterize his music. He explores intricate social concerns in the black community, such as self-hate, nihilism, poverty, identity, and institutionalized oppression, while also offering insightful commentary. His songs frequently contain a lot of metaphors and imagery, encouraging listeners to consider his message critically. While his albums explore different themes, for example, the album &#039;To pimp a Butterfly&#039; illustrates the major themes of the album as race, culture, leadership, depression, and discrimination. His love for words is evident in his poetic songs, as he embraces complex rhyming. In a video interview with Zane Lowe by Apple Music, Kendrick said, &quot;I just love words. I just love how to bend them. I love how to break them. I love how to twist them and turn them. Make them move couplets.&quot; He has set the bar so high for rappers in his generation. Currently, no rapper comes close to his lyricism. His rhyme style on &quot;Fear&quot; is old-school…I mean, like Cicero and Aristotle&#039;s old school. He is just rapping beyond all means of what we have conditioned rappers to do with a sixteen-bar verse (Prof Bradley, 2022).

Kendrick Lamar&#039;s critical acclaim and cultural impact have been possible because he focuses on quality rather than quantity in his music. He takes time in the album-making process and allows the listeners to conceptualize his previous album before dropping the next one. This has enabled his albums to receive numerous accolades and positive reviews from music professionals and fans. When he dropped his recent album &#039;Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers&#039; Kendrick received praise from critics. Some of the most airplay-friendly music Lamar has ever recorded is packed in with some of the most avant-garde work of his career (Pearce, 2022). Kendrick Lamar has won 14 Grammys and received 39 Grammy nominations overall (Mayfield, 2022). On the other hand, according to the Grammy website, Drake has won 5 Grammys and has received 55 Grammy nominations. In 2018, The Pulitzer Prizes awarded Kendrick Lamar the Pulitzer Prize for Music. Making him the only MC (rapper) to win a Pulitzer Prize (for his 2017 album &#039;DAMN&#039;). The Pulitzer Board describes his album as a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life. Kendrick Lamar is aware of the industry&#039;s effect on his people and the culture that he is a voice. He tries to challenge the stereotypes that are commercialized by the industry by talking about issues that affect blacks in the USA. Kendrick Lamar&#039;s depiction is recycled and maintained within Black ghettos themselves, where young people perform &#039;gangsta&#039; identities daily. These selectively filtered behaviors then become Black culture as well as – more importantly – the perception of Black culture (Hilkens, 2017, p.34). His being vocal about these issues has cemented him as the voice of his generation and culture, with his music being used for black resilience in the face of systematic racism. The best-known track on Kendrick Lamar&#039;s To Pimp a Butterfly, &quot;Alright&quot;, has come to be regarded as a protest anthem (Manabe, 2019).

I believe that for an artist to have artistic excellence, he or she must be experimental and have an innovative approach to his or her art. Kendrick Lamar is well known for his daring experimentation with genre-bending, pushing the bounds of traditional hip-hop and daring musical boundaries. Being open to experimenting with different sounds, unusual arrangements, and provocative ideas makes him stand out as one of the most inventive musicians of his day. His versatility is what keeps the listeners on edge and looking out for a new Kendrick song. He is not afraid to challenge the traditional notions of hip-hop while still staying true to the artistic excellence of hip-hop. Kendrick Lamar&#039;s ability to expertly incorporate elements from other musical genres, such as spoken word, jazz, funk, and soul, into his hip-hop songs is one of his signatures. This blending of styles results in a complex and nuanced soundscape that is difficult to define. &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; album, for instance, incorporates live instrumentation, jazz-inspired melodies, and complex rhythms (Fulton, 2015, p.1). apart from genre fusion, Kendricks&#039;s mastery of conceptual storytelling, narrative complexity, and collaborative spirit are critical to his experimental and innovative approach. His albums frequently read like coherent stories with recurring themes, characters, and motifs. For example, &quot;good kid, m.A.A.d city&quot; traces Lamar&#039;s coming-of-age journey in Compton, California, exploring identity, community, and resilience themes. His collaborative spirit and eagerness to work with creative producers and musicians further enhanced Kendrick Lamar&#039;s experimental approach to music. In 2015, as a producer himself, Flying Lotus respected the way Lamar pulled together and executed the concept for his album (White, 2015).

The other reason that Kendrick is the epitome of artistic excellence is his authenticity and integrity. From his lyrical content to his public image, Kendrick Lamar&#039;s authenticity and integrity are evident in every facet of his artistic expression. It is easier to conform to pressure from the industry, where the artist&#039;s persona is curated for mass appeal. Growing up around rap, with its lyrics dealing with themes such as the life of gang members, marked by the use of weapons, the drug trade, riots with the police, sexism, and hyper-masculinity (Taracido, 2023, p.8). His rise to prominence is not just a testament to his lyrical prowess but his commitment to truth-telling within the often-commodified landscape of gangsta rap. No other rapper has consistently grown in his character and how he sees the world. For instance, Kendrick&#039;s last several albums inspired thousands of young and old Black folks, people of color, and white folks to take to the streets and demand that Black Lives Matter (Dr. Driscoll, 2022). However, his new album focuses on issues in the black community, such as anti-Black racism and sexism. Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers turns the mirror away from society and instead focuses on the individual (Diehl, 2022).

Lastly, the artistic excellence of Kendrick Lamar has been evident due to his longevity since he came into the industry. Being able to accomplish what he has done so far has been something phenomenal. In an industry where the most conscious rappers hardly make an impact. He has been able to do so because of his integrity in his discography and influencing a new generation of artists to place more importance on content than commercial success. For an artist to have a chance at achieving longevity, they must first ensure that their brand is authentic (Wernick, 2019, p.55).

Some of the critics argue that Drake has a more artistic excellence compared to Kendrick Lamar due to the numbers and influence Drake has beyond hip hop. Drake being the only hip hop artist that would go toe to toe with the pop icon, Taylor Swift. In 2023, Drake and Taylor Swift are currently two of the most popular artists in the world (Kirsch, 2023). Though this might be their argument, Drake has been in mainstream media for too long unlike Kendrick Lamar. Apart from his music, Drake has also crossed over into TV shows, internet memes, fashion trends, and much more! (Virat, 2023). Despite this Kendrick has held his own against Drake considering the exposure Drake before he made headlines on mainstream media.

In conclusion, it is possible that the argument about whether Kendrick or Drake having artistic mastery over the other will never truly end. Both artists have accomplished a great deal of unparallelled achievements in the 2010s and 2020s. they both have accomplish a lot in their music careers and to propelling rap influence over the globe. Therefore, it doesn&#039;t seem appropriate to equate an artist artistic mastery to influence in the mainstream media. Whichever side of the Kendrick or Drake argument one takes, it is undeniable that both artists have had a lasting impact on the music industry and will go down as the two greatest rappers of their generation and also in the conversation among the greatest of all time.
