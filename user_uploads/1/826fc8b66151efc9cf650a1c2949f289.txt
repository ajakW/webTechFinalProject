In Kenya, women often face stereotypes in the political space. These standard notions can be linked to the social construction of gender roles in Kenya. Such as their competence being questioned, perceived as lacking assertiveness, being labeled too emotional, and being assumed better suited for supportive roles rather than leadership. All these stemmed from the long historical colonialism on the ethnicities and perpetuated by the cultural norms and religious beliefs that have held back women from being active in their respective societies&#039; leadership. For example, Christianity, which was a new way of life combined with assimilation into British culture, was acquired via schooling, and it spread the colonialist&#039;s ideologies. African women became victims of the Victorian concept of gendered roles of a woman, held by the colonialists and embraced by the African man in leadership. This continued dalliance with colonial practices and ideologies became a hangover that consecutive independence governments have been unable to cure themselves of (Mbugua, 2017).

Despite strong women like Mekatilili wa Menza, who mobilized her community to resist British rule in Kenya. While in Nairobi outside Norfolk Hotel in the 1920s, Mary Muthoni Nyanjiru led a protest following the arrest of Harry Thuku. Furthermore, women were part of the Mau Mau movement that fought for African self-determination. Women still face stereotypes in the political space.

The representation of women in politics in Kenya has immensely improved since the adoption of The 2010 constitution. The constitution was intended to transform the lives of Kenya&#039;s minorities and marginalized groups, notably women. It enshrined equality in law and led to the establishment of key institutions aimed at promoting and protecting minorities, particularly women (Kimani, 2020, p.1). The 2022 general election has shown a positive shift in women&#039;s political participation and representation. According to a UN Women Africa (2023) analysis of women&#039;s performance in the August 2022 election, the election recorded an increment in the number of women vying for elective positions, which ultimately resulted in an increased number of women successfully elected.

Though commendable progress, it does not fulfill the gender quota in the constitution that mandates that no more than two-thirds of any elected or appointed public body members be of the same gender. However, implementation has been inconsistent. As a result, the political space is still predominately men. For example, in the 2022 August election, only 10% of the elected Members of the National Assembly (MPs) were women out of the 290. This makes it difficult for the elected women to enact laws that are for women&#039;s well-being without any resistance from the men who see no essence in those laws.

Women often face practical challenges as they pursue their political endeavors. These hindrances include a lack of family-friendly policies, limited representation in leadership roles, and imposter syndrome. Thus, these challenges put them at a disadvantage when it comes to being fully committed to their political career. For example, a mother&#039;s insufficient parental leave can conflict with her work arrangements, and this is a setback to her career progression.
