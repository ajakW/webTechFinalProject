As a leader, there are some of the traits that I have identified and stand out for me as my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. I see myself as task-focused and community-oriented. I am a good planner and usually show determination to finish projects that I start. I also get along with many people because I have always lived in a large extended family, which taught me how to adjust to different personalities and situations.

One weakness is that I tend to be future-oriented, which sometimes makes me forget to appreciate the present. I also struggle at times with viewing community obligations as inconvenient, which can affect how I balance personal goals with collective needs. On top of that, I try hard to accommodate everyone, which can be draining and may cause me to lose focus on my own priorities.

I have the chance to work on being more mindful so that I can balance my future goals with the present. I can also practice tolerance and patience, especially when working with people whose views differ from mine. Another opportunity is to grow my leadership by building stronger networks and learning from mentors, which can help me develop myself further.

A major threat I face is missing out on opportunities because I do not always connect with the right people. This can limit my growth as a leader. Another threat is building shallow relationships with close people if I fail to invest in them. Finally, if I continue to over-accommodate others, I may lose sight of my own goals.
