a) Analyze the recorded times by answering the following: 
1. How does increasing data size affect population time? 
Increasing the data size increases the population time as more data is being created 
the more time it takes. As observed with 10,000 dataset it took 6.06 seconds while it 
increased from that to 38.84 seconds with 50,000 dataset and lastly for 100,000 
dataset the population time increased to 60 seconds. 

2. How does it affect search time? 
The search time increases with the increased data time; for 10,000 dataset 
"Name50000," the search time took 0.02 seconds. While for 50,000 dataset 
search time took 0.06 seconds and 100,000 dataset search time took 0.08 
seconds 

3. What conclusions can be drawn about Excel’s performance with large datasets? 
Excel performance reduces with increasing large datasets, tending to be slow when 
creating large data and retrieving information in the file system. Thus, it it not 
reliable with large data input and retrieval.
