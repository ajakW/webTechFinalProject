Report: 
The relationships between age, height, and weight show several insights. The age-height scatter 
plot reveals a non-linear relationship where height increases until approximately age 20 before 
stabilizing, reflecting typical human growth patterns. The weight distribution shows a vast 
variation across the population, with values clustering between 55-75 kg, as shown in the 
histogram. Notably, this dataset has no strong direct correlation between height and weight. 
Key Insights from Visualizations 
1. From Age-Height Scatter Plot: A clear height ceiling exists around 180 cm, with height 
stabilization occurring after age 20. That demonstrates that while people of different ages 
can reach similar heights, there tends to be a biological age with the maximum height. 
2. From Weight Bar Chart: Individual weight comparison shows significant variation, with 
clear outliers identifiable; for example, Imran (18 kg) and Katherine (82 kg) represent the 
extremes of the weight distribution. 
3. From Weight Histogram: The distribution reveals a negative skew, indicating more 
people with above-average weights than below-average weights in the sample. This insight 
also helps note that as you grow, you tend to add more weight. 
Pandas and NumPy in AI Applications 
These libraries are essential for AI applications because: 
• They provide efficient data structures for numerical computations and large dataset 
handling. 
• Pandas excel at data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. 

• NumPy's mathematical functions and broadcasting capabilities are crucial for 
implementing machine learning algorithms. 
Example 3D NumPy Array 

The three methods of checking data in pandas frame; 
• df.head() – for a quick overview of the data by displaying the first few rows of data. 
• df.info() – to get data frame information by showing data types and non-null counts 
• df.describe() – to generate a statistical summary. 

Understanding and use of inplace; 
The inplace determines whether an operation changes the existing DataFrame or returns a new 
one. Use inplace=True to make the changes reflected on the original DataFrame because it is 
memory-efficient as it does not create a copy.
